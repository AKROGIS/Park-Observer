/// This class is responsible for representing a tracklog (defined below).  A tracklog is typically built to
/// provide a polyline for the mapView or summary information for CSV export from the data in coredata.
/// A tracklog should be created then exported to CSV or the mapview and then discarded.  While the class
/// cannot be mutated, except while building, it is built from objects owned by the CoreData context, and
/// they can be changed at anytime after the tracklog is created, thereby making the tracklog incorrect.
/// The tracklog does not monitor or adjust for changes in the underlying coredata objects, so it is only
/// guaranteed correct when it is built.

// A tracklog is an ordered sequence of gpsPoints and a mission property.
// All gpsPoints have a mission; gpsPoints with different missions are on different tracklogs.
// Only points at the start/stop of a tracklog will have a mission property.
// If there is a mission property at the end of a mission, this closes the current tracklog,
// and starts a new (single point) tracklog.

// . = gps points; | = mission properties; points on the same line are the same tracklog
// the gpsPoint (.) above and below the mission properties (|) is the same gpsPoint in 2 tracklogs
// time ->

// <-    mission 1   ->     <-   mission 2   ->
//
// Note that there are three tracklogs in both missions.  The 3rd tracklog in mission 2
// has only one point.  This is a valid trackog. It will have 0 length and 0 duration.
// It is not possible to create a tracklog with no points.
//
// For the user's perspective, a mission is a tracklog (begins and ends with start/stop
// tracklogging in the user interface). The tracklog is segmented whenever the mission
// properties change (on/off transect, weather changes, etc).  In that sense what we are
// calling tracklogs could also be considered tracklog or mission segments.
