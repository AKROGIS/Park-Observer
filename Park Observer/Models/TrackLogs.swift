// A tracklog is an ordered sequence of gpsPoints and a mission property.
// All gpsPoints have a mission; gpsPoints with different missions are on different tracklogs.
// Only points at the start/stop of a tracklog will have a mission property.
// If there is a mission property at the end of a mission, this closes the current tracklog,
// and starts a new (single point) tracklog.

// . = gps points; | = mission properties; points on the same line are the same tracklog
// the gpsPoint (.) above and below the mission properties (|) is the same gpsPoint in 2 tracklogs
// time ->
// |
// ......                   |
//      |                   ..........
//      ........                     |

// <-    mission 1   ->     <-   mission 2   ->
//
// Note that there are three tracklogs in both missions.  The 3rd tracklog in mission 2
// has only one point.  This is a valid trackog. It will have 0 length and 0 duration.
// It is not possible to create a tracklog with no points.
//
// IMPORTANT: This object assumes that clients will never remove, edit or replace points, only
// append new ones in ORDER (chronologically).
