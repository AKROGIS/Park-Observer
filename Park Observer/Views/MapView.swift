// The swiftUI MapView (UIViewRepresentable) does not own the mapView (AGSMapView: UIView).
// It is owned by the environmental object: SurveyController.
// The AGSMapView maintains a ton of state and it seems overly complicated to try and make it
// play be the SwiftUI rules.  Instead I will cheat, and let various view controllers have a
// reference to the mapView via the SurveyController, so that they can coordinate their state
// with the part of the mapView that they have responsibility for.
