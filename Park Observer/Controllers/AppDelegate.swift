/// This class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the application.
/// This app delegate maintains no application state (see the Scene Delegate)
///
/// @UIApplicationMain is expanded to a main() function which is the entry point called by the OS to start the app.
/// The default main() calls UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:)  with default parameters and the name of this class.
/// UIApplicationMain() instantiates this class and attaches it to the singleton Application() class it also creates.
/// UIApplicationMain() also creates the application's scenes and scene delegates (based on instructions
/// from the app delegate) and then starts the run loop and never returns.  The app delegate and any state it owns
/// will never be deallocated, however scenes may come and go.
