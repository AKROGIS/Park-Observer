import ArcGIS  // For AGSGeoView, AGSGeoViewTouchDelegate, AGSGraphic, AGSPoint
import Foundation  // For NSObject
import SwiftUI  // For Alert(), Text()

// ArcGIS has suitable default actions for most MapView touch events:
//  pinch to zoom/rotate
//  double tap to zoom
//  drag to pan
//  long press to magnify
// There is no default action for tap.  Park Observer will provide that functionality.

// Notes:
// The _didTouchDown_ event allows the delegate the ability to "steal" subsequent events from the map view, so we
// can for example use drag events to move a graphic, instead of letting the map view pan the map. There are two
// problems with this approach: 1) If there are multiple graphics at the touch location, I need to present the user
// with a choice to know which graphic to move, at that point the touch cycle is over.  2) If I find a single graphic,
// and signal I want to steal events, I will get _didTouchDrag_ events followed by a _didCancelTouchDrag_ or a
// _didTouchUp_ event but no _didTap_ event. (I only get a _didTap_ event if I am not stealing touch events.) This
// makes sense. But, I want to display an info callout if the user taps (_didTap, or _didTouchDown_ followed by
// _didTouchUp_), and drag/move the graphic if I get a _didTouchDown, 1 or more _didTouchDrag_, then a _didTouchUp_.
// If there is none (or a few, or very small distance) _didTouchDrag_ events, then maybe this was an "accidental"
// move, and the user was actually trying to tap (this happens easily in an unstable environment like a vehicle.)
// This becomes a difficult problem of guessing the user's intention. 3) I want the system to handle panning,
// zooming and other touch events, so I need to be careful to not "steal" the events if I'm not going to use them.
// A solution these problems is to skip the _didTouch*_ events, and just monitor _didTap_ events. On the
// info display I can add a button to allow the user to move the graphic by providing just the final destination via
// an additional single tap.  I will do a move if there is a "selected" graphic when I get the _didTap_, otherwise
// will process the _didTap_ as usual to select a graphic and display its info.
// The only draw back is that there is a 1/2 second delay before I get the tap event, presumably to differentiate
// a simple tap from other touch events.
