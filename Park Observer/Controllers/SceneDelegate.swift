/// This class is responsible for managing the lifecycle of a scene (window) in the application.
/// The name of this class is specified in the Apps's info.plist file in a configuration section which referenced by name
/// in the AppDelegate configure scene method.  This class is created (along with a Scene class) and attached to the
/// scene by the UIApplicationMain(_:_:_:_:) function (implicitly declared by the @UIApplicationMain decorator in
/// AppDelegate). This file is provided with boilerplate code and delegate call stubs by XCode
///
/// The SceneDelegate is actually a WindowSceneDelegate (subclass of SceneDelegate), and it owns the window
/// that all of the scene's views draw in.  It attaches the window to the scene (the scene is fed to the window's init()
/// The SceneDelegate creates the root view (ContentView) and attaches it to the window.
